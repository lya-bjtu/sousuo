## Summary

* Name: tna_operations
* P4 version: P4_16
* Architectures: Tofino Native Architecture (TNA), Tofino2 Native Architecture (T2NA)
* Programming stack: Barefoot Runtime Interface (BRI)

Operations in the context of this example denotes interactions between the 
BRI and the chip. The tests show how to us synchronization operations to
force the update of the software counters in the runtime with the counter 
values in the chip.

Counters keep track of the packets and bytes processed by match tables. Counters can 
either be directly associated with a table entry or can be addressed by a counter id; 
the first approach is called direct counter, the latter is called indirect counter. 
This program services as an example for both types of counters. The example program 
consists of a chain of three lookup tables that match for src and dst MAC addresses 
and count the matching packets.

# 1. Summary

* P4 version: P4_16
* Architectures: Tofino Native Architecture (TNA), Tofino2 Native Architecture (T2NA)
* Programming stack: Barefoot Runtime Interface (BRI)
* Purpose: Demonstrate the usage of TNA and T2NA features and verify the P4 Studio SDE installation

The examples demonstrate how to use selected features of TNA and T2NA. 
Furthermore, the example programs serve as a test vehicle to verify that that the Barefoot P4 Studio 
SDE environment has been properly installed and configured to enable running packet tests (PTF) against 
the Tofino ASIC model for the P4-16 software stack. 

The examples in this directory are tested and verified to be functional. 
Each directory is self-contained -- it contains a readme file, the p4 file(s), and the 
PTF tests associated with the example. The P4 file with the same name as the directory 
(with a .p4 extension) is typically the main P4 file. 
Each example's readme file contains a description of what it does and special instructions on how to build or run the example, if any.

Most examples are tested on both, TNA and T2NA. Each example's readme file lists the architectures it is tested on.

Please check the corresponding readme file of an example before running it.

# 2.  Compiling

All examples are automatically built and installed by default during the P4 Studio installation process.
If needed, they can be built and installed through the P4 Studio Build tool.
The following instructions are needed only when an existing example was modified, or a new example was added.
To run an example included and built with P4 Studio, the please continue with Section 3.

An example program can be compiled by using the provided build scripts by using
the instructions below if nothing different is stated in its readme file:

```
export SDE=/path/to/sde/
export SDE_INSTALL=$SDE/install
export PATH=$SDE_INSTALL/bin:$PATH
cd $SDE/pkgsrc/p4-build
./autogen.sh
cd $SDE/build/p4-examples
```

For Tofino:
```
$SDE/pkgsrc/p4-build/configure --with-tofino --with-p4c=p4c --prefix=$SDE_INSTALL \
      --bindir=$SDE_INSTALL/bin \
      P4_NAME=<program name> \
      P4_PATH=$SDE/pkgsrc/p4-examples/p4_16_programs/<program name>/<program name>.p4 \
      P4_VERSION=p4-16 P4_ARCHITECTURE=tna \
      LDFLAGS="-L$SDE_INSTALL/lib"
```

For Tofino2:
```
$SDE/pkgsrc/p4-build/configure --with-tofino2 --with-p4c=p4c --prefix=$SDE_INSTALL \
      --bindir=$SDE_INSTALL/bin \
      P4_NAME=<program name> \
      P4_PATH=$SDE/pkgsrc/p4-examples/p4_16_programs/<program name>/<program name>.p4 \
      P4_VERSION=p4-16 P4_ARCHITECTURE=t2na \
      LDFLAGS="-L$SDE_INSTALL/lib"
```

Then, for both Tofino and Tofino2:
```
make
make install
```


# 3.  Testing

To run an example, follow these steps if nothing different is stated in its readme file:

```
export SDE=/path/to/sde/
export SDE_INSTALL=$SDE/install
sudo $SDE_INSTALL/bin/veth_setup.sh
```

In three separate terminal windows:
```
cd $SDE
./run_tofino_model.sh --arch <tofino|tofino2> -p <program name>
```
```
cd $SDE
./run_switchd.sh --arch <tofino|tofino2> -p <program name>
```
```
cd $SDE
./run_p4_tests.sh --arch <tofino|tofino2> -p <program name>
```

## Example test output:
```
